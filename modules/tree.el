;;; tree.el -- Configuration related to Tree-sitter -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file configures Tree-sitter ðŸŒ³.
;;
;; What is Tree-sitter?
;; It's a modern system for parsing code. Instead of using complex regular
;; expressions (the "old way"), Tree-sitter builds a complete, accurate
;; "syntax tree" of your code.
;;
;; Why use it?
;; 1.  **Vastly better syntax highlighting**: It understands context, so it
;;     knows the difference between a variable, a function name, and a
;;     parameter, even if they look the same.
;; 2.  **Smarter code navigation**: Allows for commands like "select the
;;     current function" or "go to the next class."
;; 3.  **Better code folding**: Folds code based on its actual structure,
;;     not just indentation.
;;
;; This file will:
;; 1.  Configure Emacs's built-in Tree-sitter support (`treesit`).
;; 2.  Install the "grammars" (parsers) for all the languages we use.
;; 3.  Remap old major modes (e.g., `python-mode`) to their new Tree-sitter
;;     counterparts (e.g., `python-ts-mode`).
;; 4.  Configure add-on packages that use Tree-sitter, like `combobulate`
;;     and `treesit-fold`.

;;; Code:

(use-package treesit
  ;; `:ensure nil` means "don't try to install this package."
  ;; We use this here because `treesit` support is *built-in* to
  ;; modern Emacs (Emacs 29+). We just need to configure it.
  :ensure nil

  ;; `:preface` runs this code *before* the package is configured.

;;; Combobulate (Advanced Tree-sitter Editing)
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ;;
  ;; `combobulate` is a package that uses the Tree-sitter tree to
  ;; provide advanced code editing and navigation, like "expand selection
  ;; to the parent node" (structural selection).

  ;; This is nested inside the `treesit` :config block, which is a
  ;; common `use-package` pattern. It means "load `combobulate`
  ;; only *after* `treesit` has been configured."
  (use-package combobulate
    ;; `:ensure nil` and `:load-path` mean this package is *not*

    ;; You must have cloned it there manually.

;;; Tree-sitter Code Folding
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

;; This package *adds* visual indicators (like `+` or `...`) in the
;; margin (the "fringe") to show you where folded code is.
(use-package treesit-fold-indicators
  :ensure (:host github :repo "emacs-tree-sitter/treesit-fold")
  ;; `:after treesit-fold` ensures that `treesit-fold` is loaded *first*,
  ;; since this package depends on it.

  ;; Turn on the indicators globally.

;; This is the standard "magic line" for an Emacs Lisp module.
;; It tells Emacs that the file `tree.el` has been loaded successfully,
;; which allows `(require 'tree)` in your `init.el` to work.
