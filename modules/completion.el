;;; completion.el -- Additional tools for completion utilities -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file configures the entire "completion" experience in Emacs. ðŸš€
;; "Completion" is Emacs's term for "autocompletion" and "fuzzy finding".
;;
;; This file is broken into two main parts:
;;
;; 1.  **Minibuffer Completion (The "Vertico Stack")**:
;;     This is for anything you do in the "command line" at the
;;     bottom of the screen (the minibuffer).
;;     - `M-x` (find command)
;;     - `C-x C-f` (find file)
;;     - `C-x b` (switch buffer)
;;     The main packages are: Vertico, Consult, Orderless, Marginalia, Embark.
;;
;; 2.  **In-Buffer Completion (The "Corfu Stack")**:
;;     This is the "autocomplete" pop-up that appears *in your code*
;;     as you are typing.
;;     The main packages are: Corfu, Cape, Tempel.
;;
;; These two "stacks" (Vertico and Corfu) are modern, minimal,
;; and work together perfectly to create a fast and powerful
;; completion system.

;;; Code:

;; First, some core Emacs completion behavior tweaks.
(use-package emacs
  :ensure nil ; `:ensure nil` means "don't install, this is built-in"

  ;; Allow running commands (like `consult-ripgrep`) *while*
  ;; you are already in the minibuffer. This is essential.

  (completion-cycle-threshold 3)
  ;; Make TAB "smart": first, it tries to indent the current line.
  ;; If the line is already indented, it then tries to complete.
  (tab-always-indent 'complete)
  ;; For Emacs 30+, turn off a new built-in completion that
  ;; can conflict with our Corfu/Cape setup.

              ("M-DEL" . vertico-directory-delete-word)))

;; Orderless: This is the "brains" of the filtering.
;; It lets you type search terms in *any order* ("out of order-less").
;; Example: `C-x b` and type "init comp" to find `completion.el` in your `init` dir.

;; you see on the right-hand side of the Vertico list.
;; - `M-x find-file` -> shows file permissions and size
;; - `M-x describe-function` -> shows the function's arguments
;; - `C-x b` -> shows the file path of the buffer

;; candidate in the minibuffer to get a pop-up of "verbs" (actions)
