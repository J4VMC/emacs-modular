# Emacs 30 Configuration for macOS

A modern, IDE-like Emacs configuration for software development. This setup provides features similar to VS Code but runs entirely in Emacs.

## What You'll Get

- **Smart Code Completion**: Like IntelliSense in VS Code
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Powered by tree-sitter (faster and more accurate)
- **Project Navigation**: File tree sidebar, fuzzy file search
- **Git Integration**: Visual Git interface (Magit)
- **Auto-formatting**: Your code formats automatically when you save
- **Error Checking**: See errors and warnings as you type
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, PHP, Swift, Scala, and more

## Prerequisites

You need macOS and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. If you don't have Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Complete Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install from Emacs+

```bash
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus

brew install emacs-plus --HEAD --with-debug --with-xwidgets --with-dbus --with-mailutils --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-curvy-3d-icon --with-ctags --with-imagemagick
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
emacs --version
```

You should see "GNU Emacs 30.2" or similar.

### Step 2: Install This Configuration

If you have an existing Emacs config, back it up first:

```bash
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
```

Clone and set up this configuration with the Gruvbox Dark Hard theme:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:J4VMC/emacs-modular.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Or if you want to clone it with the Catppuccin Mocha theme:

```bash
git clone -b catppuccin git@github.com:J4VMC/emacs-modular.git ~/.emacs.d
```

### Step 3: Install Core Tools (Required for Everyone)

These tools are needed for basic functionality:

```bash
# Libraries required by Emacs packages
brew install ripgrep fd git libgccjit libvterm imagemagick
```

That's it! The configuration is already set up to use it automatically.

### Step 4: Install Language-Specific Tools

Install tools only for languages you'll use. You can always come back and add more later.

#### Python

```bash
# Install pyenv
brew install pyenv

# Add pyenv to fish shell
set -Ux PYENV_ROOT $HOME/.pyenv
echo 'pyenv init - fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Install build dependencies
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz tcl-tk libb2 zstd zlib pkgconfig

# Install Python
pyenv install $(pyenv latest -k 3) && pyenv global $(pyenv latest 3)
# Install Pipx if not already installed
brew install pipx

# Install Python development tools
pipx install basedpyright ruff      # Language server (autocomplete, go-to-definition)

# Add all of them to the path
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin

# Virtual environment manager
pipx install poetry

**Test it works:**

```bash
which ruff  # Should show a path
```

#### Rust

```bash
# Install Rust (this also installs cargo, rustc, etc.)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Follow the prompts, then restart your terminal or run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"

# Install Rust development tools (these come with rustup)
rustup component add rust-analyzer  # Language server
rustup component add rustfmt         # Formatter
rustup component add clippy          # Linter
```

**Test it works:**

```bash
which rust-analyzer  # Should show a path in ~/.cargo/bin
```

---

#### PHP

```bash
# Install PHP
brew install php

# Install Composer (PHP package manager)
brew install composer

# Install PHP development tools
npm install -g intelephense  # Language server

```

_Test it works:_

```bash

Swift tools come with Xcode:

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Install additional Swift tools
brew install swiftlint      # Linter
brew install swift-format   # Formatter
```

**Test it works:**

```bash
which swift  # Should show /usr/bin/swift
```

Note: For the Swift LSP server, you need the full Xcode app installed (not just command line tools). Download it from the Mac App Store.

---

#### Scala

```bash
# Install Java (required for Scala)
brew install openjdk

# Install Coursier (Scala installer)
brew install coursier/formulas/coursier

# Install Scala and development tools

#### XML

```bash

### Step 5: Install Combobulate

The only package that elpaca fails to install from Github. It's a package that adds structured editing and movement to a wide range of programming languages.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mickeynp/combobulate.git ~/.emacs.d/combobulate
```

### Step 6: Start Emacs

```bash
emacs
```

**What happens on first launch:**

1. Emacs will automatically download and install packages (takes 2-5 minutes)
2. You'll see a dashboard with recent files and projects
3. The first time you open a code file, Emacs will ask to install tree-sitter grammars

**Installing tree-sitter grammars:**

- When you open a `.py`, `.js`, `.go`, or other supported file for the first time
- Emacs might prompt: "Install tree-sitter grammar for python?"
- Press `y` to install it
- This happens once per language
- You can also install them with `M-x treesit-auto-install-all`

### Step 8: Verify Everything Works

Let's test with a Python file:

1. Press `C-x C-f` (hold Control, press x, release, then hold Control and press f)
2. Type `~/test.py` and press Enter
3. Type this code:

   ```python
   def hello(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}"

   print(hello("World"))
   ```

4. Save with `C-x C-s`

**You should see:**

- ✅ Line numbers on the left
- ✅ Syntax highlighting in color
- ✅ Auto-completion popup when you type
- ✅ Code auto-formats when you save

**If something doesn't work:**

- Check that the language server is installed: `which pyright`
- Open Emacs and press `M-x lsp-doctor` (hold Option/Alt, press x, type "lsp-doctor")
- This will show you what's missing

## Understanding Emacs Key Notation

Emacs uses special notation for keyboard shortcuts:

- `C-x` = Hold Control and press x
- `M-x` = Hold Option/Alt (⌥) and press x
- `C-c t` = Hold Control and press c, then release and press t
- `s-j` = Hold Command (⌘) and press j

## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Some of the shortcuts below are custom for this configuration. All custom keybindings aim to be as ergonomic as possible to prevent the dreaded _Emacs pinky_. We don't use evil-mode because there's no point in doing that.

### Files and Buffers
